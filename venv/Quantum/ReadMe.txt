These programs were created by James Attree, with the help of my advisor Zaniar Ghadernezhad.


Requirements:
    - Qiskit
    - Networkx
    - numpy
    - matlab


Most of these programs lack a graphical user interface (GUI) and must be run in an environment with terminal access,
or they will not show results (Some however have some level of UI to show the smaller bits inside of the innerworkings).
